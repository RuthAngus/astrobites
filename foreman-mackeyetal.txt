In November 2013, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6806" target="_blank">Petigura et al.</a> found that one in twenty Sun-like stars have Earth-like planets but according to Foreman-Mackey et al. it’s more like one in fifty.

<strong>The Planet Distribution</strong>

We want to know how common Earth-like planets are. We also want to know how common Jupiter-like planets are, Neptune-like planets, hot-Jupiters, super-Earths, etc, etc. We can calculate the occurrence rate of all these different types of planets, i.e. the ‘planet population distribution’, from a homogeneous data set like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_(spacecraft)" target="_blank">Kepler’s</a>, but it’s not as simple as you might first think. You can’t just bin up all the confirmed exoplanets according to their size and orbital period and count the number in each bin - you have to take detection efficiency into account. Big exoplanets are much easier to find than small exoplanets, so if you took the naïve binning approach you would (wrongly) conclude that bigger exoplanets are more common.

The authors of this paper re-calculate the planet population distribution found by Petigura et al. in November, 2013. They use a more flexible model, impose weaker assumptions, take observational uncertainties into account and get a very different result.

<strong>Previously...</strong>

Petigura et al. measured their detection efficiency for Kepler planets by injecting fake planet transit signals into the Kepler light curves of 42,000 Sun-like stars and recovering them using their own detection algorithm. They binned the detected exoplanets according to radius and distance from their host star and calculated their “one in twenty” result by weighting the number of planets in each bin by the inverse of their detection efficiency. The authors of this paper take a slightly different approach.

<strong>Testing the model</strong>

Foreman-Mackey et al. use a histogram, where the parameters are the bin heights, to model the population of exoplanets. They assert that the distribution should be smooth - there shouldn’t be vastly more Neptune-radius planets than nearly-Neptune radius planets for example*. They use a Gaussian process* (GP) as a regulariser, forcing the distribution to be smooth. A GP can be used to model a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process" target="_blank">stochastic process</a> using information about the correlation between data points. See <a href="http://astrobites.org/2014/07/01/beyond-chi-squared-an-introduction-to-correlated-noise/" target="_blank">this astrobite</a> from Ben Montet for more about  GPs.

Foreman-Mackey et al. test the effectiveness of their model on a fake data set. They make up some exoplanet distribution and draw random samples from it - this is their fake data. They then use their model to try to recover the underlying population. As shown in figure 1, modelling the bin heights using a GP regularisation instead of simply weighting the individual bins with the inverse detection efficiency produces a less precise but more accurate estimate of the underlying distribution.

A probabilistic approach to inference is used throughout this paper – posterior distributions of the model parameters are explored using <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0175" target="_blank">elliptical slice MCMC</a> and the full set of posterior samples are available online <a href="http://figshare.com/articles/Exoplanet_population_inference/1051864" target="_blank">here</a>.

Having checked their method works the authors apply it to real data from Petigura <em>et al.</em> (2013) – see figure 2.

<strong>How common are Earth-like planets?</strong>

Despite Kepler's best efforts this question is hard to answer because we <em>haven’t found any yet - </em>we have to extrapolate. The authors of this paper calculate the rate densities of planets for a range of periods and radii. To calculate the rate of Earth-like planets they integrate over the Earth-radius, Earth-period bin. Whereas Petigura et al. found that 5.7<sup>+0.22</sup><sub>-0.017 </sub>% of Sun-like stars have Earth-like planets, Foreman-Mackey et al. find that only 1.6<sup>+0.011</sup><sub>-0.007 </sub>% do. So what is the cause of this huge discrepancy? Petigura et al. assumed that the period distribution was flat across the Earth-like bin, whereas Foreman-Mackey et al. allowed it to be flexible and find evidence that it is <em>decreasing</em>. Figure 3 shows their posterior for the rate density of Earth-like planets.

<strong>Nine Earth-like planets</strong>

In the four years of the Kepler spacecraft’s fully operational lifetime it monitored the brightness of about 150,000 stars continuously, searching for exoplanets. The jewel in Kepler’s crown was to be an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star but such a planet has still not been discovered. That doesn’t mean we should give up hope, however. The authors of this paper use their inferred exoplanet occurrence rate density to calculate the number of Earth-like planets, detectable in the Kepler data set, taking geometric transit probability into account. They find 9.2<sup>+5.9</sup><sub>-4.0</sub>. There could be NINE Earth-like exoplanets orbiting Sun-like stars, just <em>waiting</em> to be found in the Kepler data. Better get searching!

* Earth-sized planets with orbits between 200 and 400 days

* That’s not to say that that isn’t <em>possible</em> in nature, but we have no a priori reason to think so. You can see why population studies are so closely tied to formation mechanisms – if we <em>were</em> to find such a spike in Neptunes it would mean they are much better at forming than nearly-Neptunes.
